# Data Analytics and Statistical Modeling Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on statistical modeling, predictive insights, and data-driven decision making. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical applications of statistics, machine learning, and causal inference in real-world contexts.

Projects include:

## 1. Causal Analysis and Experimental Design
Observational study of booking channels and hotel cancellations using logistic regression and methods to control for confounding.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Modeling
End-to-end analysis including data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, and multivariate modeling.

## 3. Statistical Machine Learning
Predictive modeling and evaluation with focus on bias–variance tradeoffs, regularization, and validation.

## 4. Genetic Algorithm Optimization for Credit Risk
Replication and extension of research on optimization of neural network architectures for credit scoring.

## 5. End-to-End Data Analytics Pipeline
SQL-driven data pipelines and transformation of raw data into actionable insights.

This portfolio will continue to grow as new projects are refined and documented.
